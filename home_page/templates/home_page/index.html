                        Congenital heart diseases are abnormalities of the structure of the heart, which a 
                        person carries with him from the day of his birth. In other words, those suffering 
                        from congenital heart diseases are born with some "structural" problem in the heart. 
                        The word "kin" means "by birth." The term should not be confused with "kinship," in 
                        the sense of heredity, with which it has but little to do.
